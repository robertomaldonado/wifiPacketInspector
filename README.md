To perform the packet analysis we use R
run Project3.R to create a file named: "LTSOutput.txt"

This is the chain of convolutional encoding.
The file must be modified to erase the literal part of the data.

Which is disassembled in python running:

    python inspect.py

The final output is the packet size found inside the header of the PLCP.
